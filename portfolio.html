                My name is Zarit Ortiz and I am 26 years old. I am Puerto Rican, fluent in both English and
                Spanish.
                I am
                taking this class to further educate myself in order to get a great and happy career. I am
                learning
                a
                lot of stuff in this course already that I have mever even heard of as well as trying to improve
                my
                ability to type. I have a dog named Ziggy who I am completely in love and obsessed with. I work
                at
                Cheesecake Factory currently as a server.
